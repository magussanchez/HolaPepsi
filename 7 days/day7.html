    <h1>Buenos Aires: city of passion</h1>
    <p class="p">In Buenos Aires it's not just the tango that will set your blood racing. Rodney Bolt reports from a city with a taste for high drama and an
    all-or-nothing approach to life.</p>

    <p class="p">Buenos Aires is often billed as the Paris of the South, and it certainly has the appropriate sophistication, the fin-de-siècle grace, and the
    couture.</p>
    <p class="p">But the real magic of the city lies in something essentially Latin. Trying to discover just what that something is can be the most
    fascinating part of a visit. Marlene Dietrich came close when she said: "Latinos are tenderly enthusiastic. In Brazil they throw flowers at you.
    <p class="p">In Argentina they throw themselves."</p>
    <p class="p">"We don't have a middle road," agrees one young porteño (a person from Buenos Aires). "We love or we hate."</p>
    <p class="p">The rooms at Legado Mitíco, my hotel in the Palermo Viejo district, were named after revered Argentines – the mystical writer Jorge Luis Borges,
    tango star Carlos Gardel, Evita Perón, of course, as well as a couple of military heroes, and even the comic-strip character Mafalda (an acerbic
    six year-old). Curiously, though, no Maradona. Perhaps the footballer didn't quite fit the hotel's stylish image, or maybe the omission was out of
    sensitivity to English guests' feelings.</p>
    <p class="p">Legado Mitíco is just a few yards from the house where Borges grew up, right at the spot that, in a poem called Buenos Aires, he imagines to be
    the site of the mythical foundation of the city. In his day (he died in 1986), Palermo Viejo was a shabby outer suburb, inhabited by knife-wielding
    gauchos and bandits who drank hard and fought in the taverns. Today, with its leafy, cobbled streets and buildings bedecked with decorative stucco,
    the quarter is filled with hip bars, designer boutiques and restaurants such as the traditional Don Julio, famed for its grills, and La Cabrera,
    currently hot-tipped as best in town for beef, where queues of chic porteños form nightly.</p>

  <h5>When to go</h5>
  <p class="p">Spring, when the jacaranda trees break into spectacular mauve blossom, and autumn are the loveliest times to visit. Midsummer (January and February)
  can be humid, and the La Sudestada southerly winds can bring drenching downpours in the winter months of June to October.</p>

  <div class="col-1">
  <h5>Getting around</h5>
  <p class="p">It is safer to ask your hotel or restaurant to phone for a radio-taxi or remise (private cab), or to pick up a taxi from an official rank, than
  it is to hail one in the street. Buenos Aires has a cheap, efficient, though frequently very busy, metro (Subte) network. The bus service is more
  esoteric, but the booklet Guia “T” (available at news kiosks) will help you decipher routes and numbers.</p>
