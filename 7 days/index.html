<h2>News</h2>
  <p>A young woman who struggled with anorexia and bulimia has been given a<br>
    'new chance at life' after beating her eating disorders in a partial hospitalization program.</p>
  <p>Psychology student, Giannylee Santiago, 21, of New York started to restrict food<br>
    at the age of just 15 as a coping mechanism for when her grades were dropping.</p>
  <p>She survived on just one cereal bar and 16oz of fluids a day and over time, Giannylee's<br>
     anorexia turned into bulimia where she would binge eat just so she didn't faint after <br>
     her three-hour workouts.</p>
  <p>At her lowest, Giannylee weighed 124lbs and that's when she reached out to a counselor<br>
    at university for help after realizing how her eating disorder was affecting how she viewed<br>
    her life.</p>
  <p>After being on a partial hospitalization program, Giannylee learned different coping<br>
    mechanisms and is now a healthy 158lbs.</p>
  <p>'It wasn't about wanting to be skinny, it was about having control of my life. At the<br>
    moment I was failing a class, and I didn't know what to do. I used food as my coping skill.<br>
    I restricted for a year, then turned to bulimic behaviors,' she said.</p>
  <p>'I started restricting breakfast, I would get up ten-minutes before it was time to leave for school.<br>
     Then I skipped lunch, I would study or do homework assignments during that period, after school<br>
     I had volleyball practice every day during the first semester and I wouldn't eat until I got home very late at night.'</p>
  <p>'Every day was the same routine from Monday to Friday. The weekends were a little bit<br>
    different, I worked out every morning for three hours and I would binge to not faint.'</p>
  <p>Giannylee felt so numb and foggy that she doesn't mentally remember being at places because<br>
     she was 'in her own world' and 'would get mad at anyone who told me I needed help'.</p>
  <p>'After six years of struggling it started affecting the way I looked at life.<br>
    It interfered with my education, I was not longer getting the perfect grades, I was struggling<br>
     to even show up and get out of bed,' she said.</p>
  <p>'My eyes were vivid red from all the popped blood vessels and the headaches were too painful.<br>
     I drifted from everyone and I was lying to friends and family.'</p>
  <p>'I reached out to my counselor here on campus and between her and a nurse, we agree I should receive treatment.'</p>
  <p>Choosing to overcome her eating disorder was a challenge but the most difficult thing<br>
    about Giannylee's recovery was shutting out the negative thoughts that surfaced every meal time.</p>
  <p>'It is a challenge, every single day. You wake up and you have to keep choosing recovery.<br>
    It is not something that happens overnight. Going to a treatment center does not cure you,' she added.</p>
  <p>'I was on a partial hospitalization program (PHP) for two admissions, ten-weeks each and was<br>
     able to learn a lot of coping mechanisms to deal with the anxiety and being able to refrain from<br>
     using eating disorder symptoms during or after meals.'</p>
  <p>'I feel more aware of my surroundings, and myself. Being in intensive treatment for so<br>
     long I learned to look at things from a different perspective.'</p>
  <p>'The most difficult part was challenging the negative thoughts. With every meal, the<br>
    eating disorder thoughts got louder and louder telling me to not nourish my body, telling me<br>
    how much weight I would be gaining and my entire life would go downhill.'</p>
  <p>Giannylee said that with every meal, there was a lot of anxiety and tears but she was able<br>
     to get through it with the help of the kitchen staff and dietitian.</p>
  <p>'I have been on this recovery journey for almost a year now, and completely symptom<br>
    free for six months. I feel like I was given a new chance at life, a healthy life,' she said. </p>
  <p>'I now appreciate my family, friends and opportunities more. I make sure to let people know<br>
    how thankful I am and how they mean to me. I make sure to live life to the fullest and do<br>
    exactly what I want. I no longer listen to any voices and it feels great.'</p>
  <p>'You do not have to have physical symptoms to be taken seriously. You could be in a healthy<br>
     weight range and still struggle with an eating disorder.'</p>
  <p>Giannylee's family and friends have been her motivation throughout her recovery and she now<br>
    says she would choose recovery again if she had to.</p>
  <p>'You are worth it, and you should reach out for help in any conditions. Do not wait until is too<br>
    late, the consequences could be life long lasting. Recovery is hard but I would do it all over again.<br>
    It is so worth it,' she said.</p>
  <p>'I feel like I was given a new chance at life from a healthy perspective and I plan on taking<br>
    full advantage. You can do it. Follow my Instagram account for motivation or if you need to talk @giasfight.<br>
    My DM's are always open.'</p>
  <p>'I work very closely with my treatment team. It helps me stay accountable. I also got a tattoo<br>
    on the right side of my body of my favorite mantra, I'm okay, I can do this with the NEDA<br>
    (National Eating Disorders Association) symbol as motivation, and it keeps me from body checking.'</p>

<p class="white"><b>chessiekingg</b> Smooth skin, peachy booty, small waist, thin thighs... you can have it all in just 30 seconds of editing üíÅüèº‚ôÄÔ∏è It‚Äôs scary how easily & quickly you can change your body on some of these apps.¬†@lydiaxcollins& I had a play round to see how ‚Äòmodern day perfect‚Äô we could make me look but still making it look ‚Äòreal‚Äô.
<br>Instagram can be so encouraging & inspiring but it‚Äôs also a ‚Äòperfection‚Äô trap 95% of the time & it can be so unhealthy & it still effects me.
<br>I want you to be able relate to me & look at my body & know it‚Äôs achievable. I want you to see me & know I look exactly the same in real life as I do on here.
<br>Yes people work extremely hard for their bodies & some people do look like the right but the rest of us gals should not have to feel like shüçåt if we don‚Äôt üíÉüèº Sending allllll my love to anyone that‚Äôs compared themselves to another human today or wished they looked like that person on Instagram.
<br>You‚Äôre beautiful, in your own unique way ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõ</p>
