			<p class="a"><b>WHAT IS SCOLIOSIS?</b><br>
				Scoliosis is a condition that affects the neuromuscular system,<br>
				causing the spine to bend in a C-shaped curve or S-shaped curve. About 80 percent of casesare adolescent idiopathic scoliosis<br>
				(AIS), which means of unknown cause.<br>
				AIS affects 2-3 percent of children. It's most
				common in girls age 10 and older, yet boys get AIS, as well. Your child may not have obvious signs or pain if<br>
				scoliosis is detected in its early stages.</p>

			<p class="aa"><b>HOW HAS SCOLIOSIS BEEN TREATED?</b><br>
				Observation, bracing and surgery are the<br>
				three most common treatments for scoliosis. Often, doctors will recommend monitoring curves that measure less than 25 degrees, scoliosis braces when curves reach 25 degrees,<br>
				and surgery if curves progress to 40 degrees or greater. It is not the intention of ScoliSMART™<br>
				doctors to condemn the efforts of sincere and caring medical professionals who have dedicated their<br>
				lives to helping people with scoliosis, but we cannot<br>
				support any of these historic treatments because they all have poor outcomes.<br>
				Observing a mild curve simply allows time for the curve to worsen. The wait and watch period of six months or a year is<br>
				often stressful on you and your child because you want to be proactive. We do, too.<br>
				We opt to start non-invasive scoliosis. Auto Response Training exercises as soon as possible.<br>
				Bracing holds your child's spine straight<br>
				during the 18-23 hours a day it's worn. This rigid treatment, however, causes muscles to atrophy and joints to be still and sore. Scoliosis braces often cause pain and breathing difficulty in children who<br>
				were pain-free and breathing perfectly fine before<br>
				using one. Additionally, bracing doesn't stop scoliosis progression. Often,<br>
				a patient's scoliosis curve quickly<br>
				gets drastically worse when the brace treatment ends.<br>
				Spinal fusion surgery is the treatment we disagree with most. It's invasive, has severe complications, and causes disability in 40 percent of people within two decades, according to medical studies. It's an especially poor choice for teens whose spines are not yet developed.</p>

			<p class="aaa"><b>RECOVERY</b><br>
				<b>Pain Management —</b> Just after scoliosis surgery, most patients are given PCA<br>
				(patient-controlled analgesia). PCA is a pump that delivers<br>
				morphine or other narcotic at the press of a button by the patient.<br>
				This controls pain very well for the first two to three days after surgery. Thereafter, PCA is stopped<br>
				and oral pain medication is administered. At hospital discharge, a prescription for pain medication is provided.<br>
				Adults may require medication at diminishing doses for weeks or months.	Children are usually off medication within two weeks.<br>
				<b>Drains —</b> A drain prevents fluid accumulation at the incision site and is routine.<br>
				Most patients have a drain in their back or side<br>
				for two to three days after surgery. Drains in the side of the chest are termed 'chest tubes'<br>
				and prevent air and fluid from accumulating around the lungs. Drains are removed when fluid drainage is small.<br>
				Drain removal is not painful. A urinary catheter (Foley) helps to keep the patient<br>
				comfortable. It may be removed two or three days<br>
				after surgery. <br>
				<b>Walking —</b> Physical therapists and nurses help<br>
				the patient out of bed on the first or second day after surgery. Walking is guided by the physical therapist and is increased daily as tolerated.<br>
				Some patients may need a walker or cane early during recovery to help with balance and prevent a fall.<br>
				keep their balance. Most children do not need walking aids at home. <br>
